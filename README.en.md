**Mary is the most perfect company in my heart.

For some reasons, I can no longer post on certain platforms, but as programmers, we have our own blogs.   I refuse to believe that even GitHub would be off-limits!

This morning, after finishing my lab class, on my way back, I found that my trending topics had disappeared (they were still visible on the homepage).   I was both angry and excited.   I was about to eat my meal, but I completely lost my appetite.   I quickly took a few bites and rushed to express my admiration for another company—Mary.

Autumn Recruitment Group Chat
There’s an autumn recruitment group!   Many smaller companies don’t even have this.   In this group, HR and managers frequently post recruitment FAQs and tips.   Issues like being left on "read" simply don’t exist!!!

Choose Your Own Interview Time
You can pick your own interview time!   Many companies can’t do this.   If the interviewer is delayed due to some issue, you’ll only need to wait a little—just about half a month.   As long as you report the issue across different channels (email, BOSS, group chats), it’s only a matter of waiting a little over half a month!

Great Interview Experience
The interview experience is excellent!   Most interviewers won’t turn on their cameras but require you to turn on yours, which effectively reduces the possibility of cheating.

Track the Process via Public Accounts
You can track your interview progress via their public account!   Within minutes after the interview, you’ll see if you’ve advanced to the business review stage.   Just check twice daily for over a month, and you’ll discover you’ve moved on to the next stage!   Other companies just make you wait.

OC Letter of Intent
This isn’t an exaggeration—many companies don’t even offer a letter of intent, but Comb Style Mary does!   They even tell you explicitly that there will be a phone call discussion in mid-November.   All you have to do is wait patiently.   If you have other offers, you can safely decline them.   Feeling impatient?   Don’t forget we have a group!   You can ask your questions there and get an immediate response!!!

No Annoying Sorting Ranks!
Other companies have a process like issuing intent letters, followed by discussions, then sorting by educational background or interview evaluations.   But that’s nonexistent here!   They have a unique sorting algorithm, sparing you from all that torment!!

Offer Phone Call Discussions
This is so formal.   Some smaller companies don’t even send emails;   they just use WeChat or SMS.   During these calls, they even provide more options, like technical support or customer service roles, giving you a better career experience!!!

What If You Don’t Get the Call?
Don’t worry, be patient.   After all, there will be announcements in the group.   If you’ve declined offers from other companies and still haven’t gotten a call here, congratulations, you’ve learned your first life lesson for free!   A seamless transition from graduation to the real world, without spending a penny!!

Summary:
In my opinion, Comb Style Mary excels in both interviews and follow-ups, making it the most perfect company in my heart.   They truly consider the job seeker’s perspective!   Even without communication, they gift you a free lesson!!!

Disclaimer:
Do not spread or believe in rumors.   The acceptance rate exceeds expectations but isn’t directly proportional.   Limited vacancies;   recruitment stops when full.   If there’s spring recruitment, evaluate the situation on your own.
